This post might contain some tidbits of info, but don't count on it.
It's old and probably not relevant. Kept here for historical reasons..

# Intro #

I (as probably you), like to customize every aspect of your daily rutine to be as good and efficient as possible.
The smart phones that everyone is walking around with today have a potential that is much bigger than what their users uses them for.

I will write a couple of blog posts about my own setup after a great amount of customizing, buying apps (which wasn’t worth it), reflashing, redesigning and a lot of try and fails.
This first post is just a list of my favorite apps..

Note; that I don't use any screenshots, but I will provide links and descriptions.
Note2; that this is my own personal perfect setup. The best I've found, at the moment.. Please comment if you have better ideas!

# General setup #

* Phone: [Samsung Galaxy S3]
* Android: 4.1
* Rooted: yes!
* Mod: [Cyanogenmod 10]

# Apps #

PS: I have left out some apps from the list, which are good, but not about this blogpost. Like [1Weater], [GMail], [Linkedin], [GitHub], [Google StreatView], [Google Maps], [Google Drive], [Dropbox], [Firefox], [Google Goggles], [Evernote] and so on.. This list is about getting most out of the phone in general, not which todo-list, mail, hobbies I have :) I also took out [Felleskatalogen] and [Gule Sider] which is both Norwegian apps.

PS2: Sorry about the Norwegian currency (converted manually to usd as well). If there is a way to force google play store into displaying the currency in USD, please share! So prices are in NOK/USD!

PS3: The need root list might be a little uncomplete. But that doesn’t mather, because everyone should root their phone :)

PS4: Most of the apps that costs money in this list have free versions as well.. Try them first!
