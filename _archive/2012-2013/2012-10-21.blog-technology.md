:::warning Old and probably not relevant
Kept here for historical reasons.. I don't use much of the content here anymore.

Looks like Pelican is still around tho (2021), but as said, not using it anymore..

After going back and forth to what technology I wanted behind my blog I decided on;

# [Pelican] as the static blog generator #
Pelican is written in python, is very extendible with plugins and easy to create themes.
It is also easy to configure and use. The main reason I went with pelican is its simplicity, and possibility to customize.

There is already other blogs out there that explains [pelican advantages and disadvantages] and other blogs that have info about [using github pages and pelican], so that is not something I will spend time on here. But if you like to blog using plain-text, python, html/js/css customization and a power full generator to put it into a blog, pelican might be something to check out.

# [Multimarkdown] as the writing "format" #
Multimarkdown is an extension to [markdown]. Markdown is a structured way of writing articles, snippets, mail or even whole books. It was created as a way to write plaintext which can later be converted to html/pdf/odt/LaTeX or whatever you want, keeping the structure you want.

To be honest, everyone who sends mail on a daily bases should at least look into this. Or at least thing about it. Getting mails that contains a lot of text, and no structure is painful to read.

When it comes to Markdown vs. [reStructuredText], I ended up with markdown because it feels much bigger than rst. Even tough rst is something which the python community uses a lot, it just feels a little dead. I have even tried to use rst for a long time, but it is missing some love from other people.

# [Github pages] for hosting the generated html files #
I love using Github for [my opensourced projects], so it felt very natural to use their pages to store the html files for my blog. It is free, easy to publish to, and stable. I don't really have much more to say on this. But if my blog was not going to be a bunch of static files, I would probably have used [Heroku].
